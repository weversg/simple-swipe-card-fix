Simple Swipe Card is a customizable container for Home Assistant that lets you place multiple cards in a single space and navigate between them with intuitive swipe gestures. The card optimizes dashboard space by grouping related information while providing a mobile-friendly interface with smooth touch and mouse navigation. It features pagination indicators, adjustable card spacing, and full visual editor support. Ideal for creating room-specific views, device dashboards, or organizing related information without cluttering your dashboard, Simple Swipe Card enhances both functionality and user experience with minimal configuration.


## Features
- Swipe between multiple cards
- Pagination dots
- Configurable card spacing
- Visual editor support
- Multiple loop modes
- Support for both horizontal and vertical swiping
- Template Support: Use Jinja2 or JavaScript templates for dynamic configuration values
- Automatic Slideshow (Auto-Swipe):
    - Cards can cycle automatically at a user-defined interval
    - Auto-swipe intelligently pauses during manual user interaction (e.g., manual swipe, pagination click) and resumes after 5 seconds (not configurable)
    - Integrates with `loop_mode: infinite` for continuous cycling or uses a "ping-pong" effect if `loop_mode: none` is set
- Reset After Timeout: Automatically start at and return to a target card after inactivity. When enabled, the card begins at the specified reset target and returns to it after user inactivity
- State Synchronization: Two-way sync with Home Assistant `input_select` and `input_number` entities

## View Modes
Simple Swipe Card offers two distinct view modes to suit different use cases:

### Single Mode (Default)
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nutteloost/simple-swipe-card/refs/heads/main/images/simple-swipe-card_single_example.gif" width=600px alt="Single view mode" title="Single view mode" style="border-radius:20px">

Displays one card at a time with full support for all features. This is the traditional card view where users swipe to navigate between individual cards.

### Carousel Mode

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nutteloost/simple-swipe-card/refs/heads/main/images/simple-swipe-card_carousel_example.gif" width=600px alt="Carousel view mode" title="Carousel view mode" style="border-radius:20px" >

Displays multiple cards simultaneously with partial visibility of adjacent cards, similar to a carousel. Users can see preview portions of neighboring cards while focusing on the current card.

> [!NOTE]  
> Vertical swiping is not available in carousel mode (horizontal only).

## Swipe Behavior

Simple Swipe Card has two ways to handle swiping:

### Single Behavior (Default)
Each swipe moves exactly one card. This gives you precise control and works with all loop modes.

### Free Behavior
Swipe multiple cards at once based on how fast and far you swipe. A quick swipe can jump several cards while a gentle swipe moves just one. It feels natural and smooth, like swiping through photos on your phone.

> [!NOTE]  
> Free swipe behavior only works when `loop_mode` is set to `infinite`.

## Configuration
This card can be configured using the visual editor or YAML.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When using `swipe_direction: "vertical"` without configuring `grid_options` in your dashboard layout, the card automatically applies a default height of 250px to prevent layout issues. For full height control with vertical swiping, configure `grid_options` in the layout tab of the visual editor or add it to the Yaml configuration

### Options
| Name | Type | Default | Description |

> [!WARNING]  
> Infinite loop mode creates duplicate cards for a true seamless scrolling experience which can be resource-intensive with camera cards or complex cards. Consider using `loop_mode: loopback` for better performance

> [!NOTE]
> **Auto Height Compatibility**: The `auto_height` feature is only available when using:
> - View Mode: Single (not carousel)
> - Swipe Direction: Horizontal (not vertical)
> - Loop Mode: None or Loopback (not infinite)
>
> When switching to an incompatible mode, `auto_height` will be automatically removed from your configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> **Backdrop Filter Support**: The `enable_backdrop_filter` option allows CSS `backdrop-filter` effects (blur, etc.) to work with card-mod. Due to browser limitations, `backdrop-filter` conflicts with `clip-path`, which is used for dropdown overflow. When enabled:
> - ✅ Backdrop-filter effects work correctly
> - ❌ Dropdown menus do not overflow card boundaries
>
> Only enable this option if you're using `backdrop-filter: blur()` in your card-mod CSS and need it to work. The toggle is available in the Advanced Options section of the visual editor.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
type: custom:simple-swipe-card
cards:
  - type: weather-forecast
    entity: weather.home
  - type: entities
    entities:
      - sensor.temperature
      - sensor.humidity
  - type: media-control
    entity: media_player.living_room
show_pagination: true
auto_hide_pagination: 3000
card_spacing: 15
loop_mode: infinite
swipe_direction: horizontal
swipe_behavior: single
enable_auto_swipe: false
auto_swipe_interval: 3000
enable_reset_after: true
reset_after_timeout: 45000
reset_target_card: 1
state_entity: input_select.dashboard_cards
```

## Template Support

Simple Swipe Card supports both Jinja2 and JavaScript templates for dynamic configuration. Use templates to set `reset_target_card`, `reset_after_timeout`, or `auto_swipe_interval` based on entity states, time, or user context.

### Jinja2 Templates

Use Jinja2 syntax to create dynamic values based on entity states or time calculations:

```yaml
reset_target_card: "{{ states('sensor.your_sensor') | int }}"
reset_after_timeout: "{{ 30000 if is_state('input_boolean.quick_mode', 'on') else 60000 }}"
```

### JavaScript Templates

Use JavaScript templates for more complex logic. JavaScript templates have access to `user` (with `user.name` and `user.id`), `states` object, and `hass` object. Wrap your code in `[[[` and `]]]`:

```yaml
reset_target_card: |
  [[[
    if (user.name === 'Admin') {
      return 2;
    }
    return 1;
  ]]]
```

Templates are evaluated dynamically and update automatically when referenced entities change.

## State Synchronization

Simple Swipe Card can synchronize its current position with Home Assistant entities (helpers), enabling external control and automation integration through two-way binding. This powerful feature allows for dynamic, automated dashboard interactions based on events, time, or other conditions.

### Supported Entities

**Input Select (`input_select`)**
- Options are mapped by position to visible cards (option 1 = card 1, option 2 = card 2, etc.)
- Changing the input_select value navigates to the corresponding card
- Swiping to a card automatically updates the input_select value

**Input Number (`input_number`)**
- Uses 1-based indexing where 1 = first card, 2 = second card, etc.
- Changing the input_number value navigates to the corresponding card
- Swiping to a card automatically updates the input_number value

### Option/Card Count Handling
- **More options than cards**: Extra options are ignored and cannot be selected.
- **Fewer options than cards**: Only cards corresponding to available options can be controlled externally. Cards without corresponding options can still be reached through manual swiping but won't update the entity.
- **Visibility conditions**: State synchronization works with visible cards only. If cards are hidden due to visibility conditions, the mapping adjusts automatically to match only the currently visible cards.

</p>

### Example Use Case

**Security Camera Alert**: When motion is detected at your front door, the Simple Swipe Card can automatically switch to display the camera feed, providing immediate visual confirmation of activity without requiring manual navigation. This ensures critical security events receive instant attention when they matter most.

<details>

<summary><strong>Example automation:</strong></summary>

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Switch Simple Swipe Card slide to Camera on Motion"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door_motion
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: input_number.set_value
        target:
          entity_id: input_number.dashboard_card_selector
        data:
          value: 3  # Assuming camera card is the 3rd card
```
</details>


## Visibility Conditions

Individual cards within the Simple Swipe Card can be conditionally shown or hidden using visibility conditions. Multiple conditions use AND logic (all must be true).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Visibility conditions are added to individual cards within your Simple Swipe Card configuration, not to the Simple Swipe Card configuration itself. 


## Known Limitations & Troubleshooting

### Card Picker Loading

Due to Home Assistant's architecture, the card picker may not load immediately when first opening the Simple Swipe Card editor after clearing browser cache.

**Simple Fix:** If you see an empty card picker section:
1. Click the "+" (Add Card) button on your dashboard once
2. Close the dialog that opens  
3. Return to editing your Simple Swipe Card - the card picker will now work perfectly

This only needs to be done once per browser session.

### Interactive iframe-based Cards

Simple Swipe Card intercepts mouse and touch events to enable swipe gestures, which can interfere with interactive iframe-based cards that require direct user interaction.

**Affected card types include:**
- Custom cards that embed external websites or services
- Cards with embedded video players requiring direct controls
- Third-party widgets that use iframe elements
- Any card that relies on complex mouse interactions

## Customizing with Theme Variables

The Simple Swipe Card provides extensive customization capabilities through two primary methods: Home Assistant themes and card-mod styling. This flexible approach allows you to establish consistent styling across all card instances while maintaining the ability to customize individual cards as needed.

### Method 1: Home Assistant Themes

Apply styling globally across all instances of Simple Swipe Card by adding theme variables to your Home Assistant configuration. This method is ideal for maintaining consistent styling throughout your dashboard.

To apply these customizations, add them to your theme in your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
frontend:
  themes:
    simple_swipe_theme:
      # Your existing theme properties
      primary-color: '#2196f3'
      
      # Simple Swipe Card customizations
      simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-active-color: '#ff5722'
      simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-size: '10px'
      simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-spacing: '6px'
      simple-swipe-card-transition-speed: '0.4s'
      simple-swipe-card-pagination-background: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'
      # Add any other variables from the complete CSS reference
```

### Method 2: Card-Mod Styling

Apply styling directly to individual card instances using card-mod. This method provides maximum flexibility and allows for unique styling of specific cards. Card-mod styles take precedence over theme variables, enabling you to override global themes for specific instances.

```yaml
type: custom:simple-swipe-card
cards:
  - type: weather-forecast
    entity: weather.home
  - type: entities
    entities:
      - sensor.temperature
card_mod:
  style: |
    :host {
      --simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-active-color: #ff5722;
      --simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-size: 12px;
      --simple-swipe-card-transition-speed: 0.5s;
      /* Add any other variables from the complete CSS reference */
    }
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When both theme variables and card-mod styling are present, the following hierarchy applies:
> 
> 1. Card-mod styles (highest priority)
> 2. Theme variables
> 3. Default card styling (lowest priority)

### Available CSS Variables

All CSS variables listed below can be used in both Home Assistant themes and card-mod styling configurations. These variables provide comprehensive control over the visual appearance and behavior of the Simple Swipe Card.


#### Pagination Dot Basic Styling
```yaml
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-size: 8px;                                   /* Diameter of inactive pagination dots */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-active-size: 8px;                            /* Diameter of the active pagination dot */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-active-color: var(--primary-color, #03a9f4); /* Color of the currently selected dot */

--simple-swipe-card-pagination-padding: 4px 8px;                                /* Padding around the pagination dots */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-bottom: 8px;                                     /* Distance from bottom edge (horizontal mode) */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-right: 8px;                                      /* Distance from right edge (vertical mode) */
```

#### Pagination Auto-Hide Animation

```yaml
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-fade-duration: 600ms;                            /* Duration of each dot's fade animation */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-animation-type: 'fade';                          /* Animation pattern: 'fade', 'left-to-right', 'right-to-left', 'center-out', 'edges-in', 'random' */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-animation-delay: 50ms;                           /* Delay between individual dot animations (ignored for 'fade' pattern) */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-animation-easing: ease-out;                      /* CSS easing function for dot animations */
```

#### Animation and Transition Effects
```yaml
--simple-swipe-card-transition-speed: 0.3s;                                     /* Duration of slide transition animations */
--simple-swipe-card-transition-easing: ease-out;                                /* Easing function for slide animations */
```

### Animation Customization Examples

You can use any valid CSS transition timing function for `simple-swipe-card-transition-easing`:

```yaml
# Example animation customizations
simple-swipe-card-transition-speed: '0.5s'                          # Slower animation
simple-swipe-card-transition-easing: 'ease-in-out'                  # Smooth in and out
simple-swipe-card-transition-easing: 'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)' # Material Design easing
simple-swipe-card-transition-easing: 'linear'                       # Constant speed
